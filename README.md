========================

This is my GitHub website which I plan to use to post lists of useful tutorials and tools. I am a postdoc in the [@rafalab](http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu) in the [Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology](http://bcb.dfci.harvard.edu) at [Dana-Farber Cancer Institute](http://www.dana-farber.org) and [Harvard School of Public Health](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/biostatistics/).  

My research interests focus around developing statistical methods and tools in application for genomics and epigenomics data. Currently, I am focused on methods for processing and analyzing DNA methylation and gene expression using microarrays and next-generation sequencing.
