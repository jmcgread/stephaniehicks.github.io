========================

This is my GitHub website. I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu). I'm also a faculty member of the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab](http://jhudatascience.org) and co-founder of [R-Ladies Baltimore](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-baltimore/). 

I develop statistical methods, tools and software for the analysis of genomics data. Specifically, my research addresses statistical challenges in epigenomics, functional genomics and single-cell genomics such as the pre-processing, normalization, analysis of raw, noisy high-throughput data (microarray and next-generation sequencing) leading to an improved quantification and understanding of biological variability.
