\section{Research Interests}
I develop statistical methods, tools and software for the analysis of genomics data. Specifically, my research addresses statistical challenges in epigenomics, functional genomics and single-cell genomics such as the pre-processing, normalization, analysis of raw, noisy high-throughput data (microarray and next-generation sequencing) leading to an improved quantification and understanding of biological variability. This work resulted in a \href{https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9243746&icde=32574421&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=}{K99/R00 grant} from the \href{https://www.genome.gov}{National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)}.
