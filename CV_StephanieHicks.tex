%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.

\section{Research Interests}
My research interests focus around developing statistical methods and tools in application for genomics and epigenomics data. Currently, I am focused on methods for processing and analyzing DNA methylation and gene expression using microarrays and next-generation sequencing. 

%\section{Teaching Interests}
%In addition to teaching traditional probability and statistics courses, I am particularly interested in developing more diverse courses in a Statistics or Biostatistics department with the goal of teaching statistical methods and tools for reproducible and replicable research to meet the growing demand of data scientists by offering non-theoretical courses targeted at individuals wanting to learn how to become a data scientist.
