#### Research Interests
My research interests focus around developing statistical methods and tools in application for genomics data. Currently, I am focused on methods for processing and analyzing DNA methylation and gene expression using microarrays and next-generation sequencing. Here are a few software packages and data packages that I have authored:


#### Software

- [R/quantro](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/quantro.html): R package available on Bioconductor to test for global differences between groups of distributions to decide when to use quantile normalization.
- [R/quantroSim](https://github.com/stephaniehicks/quantroSim): Supporting data simulation R-package for the \textit{quantro} R-package 
to simulate gene expression and DNA methylation data.
- [R/explainr](https://github.com/hilaryparker/explainr): translates S3 objects into text using standard templates in a simple and convenient way. 
- [postMUT](https://github.com/stephaniehicks/postMUT): A tool implemented in Perl and R to predict the functionality of missense mutations.


#### Data Packages

- [myAffyData](https://github.com/stephaniehicks/mycAffyData): AffyBatch object from an experiement using P493-6 cells expressing low or high levels of c-Myc. Data from Loven et al. (2012) Cell 151: 476-482.
- [BackgroundExperimentYeast](https://github.com/stephaniehicks/BackgroundExperimentYeast): AffyBatch object from an experiment to measure NSB and optical noise in yeast.

#### Talks

- [Why Statistics Matters in the Analysis of Genomics Data](https://speakerdeck.com/stephaniehicks/why-statistics-matters-in-the-analysis-of-genomics-data): Presented at the LSU Computational Biology seminar and the LSUConnect event in Feb 2015.
