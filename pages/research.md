#### Research Interests
My research interests are focused on developing statistical methods, tools and software for the analysis of genomics data. Specifically, my research addresses statistical and computational challenges in functional genomics such as the pre-processing, normalization, analysis of raw high-throughput data (microarray and next-generation sequencing) leading to an improved quantification and understanding of biological variability. Here are a few software packages and data packages that I have authored:


#### Software

- [R/quantro](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/quantro.html): R package available on Bioconductor to test for global differences between groups of distributions to decide when to use quantile normalization.
- [R/quantroSim](https://github.com/stephaniehicks/quantroSim): Supporting data simulation R-package for the *quantro* R-package 
to simulate gene expression and DNA methylation data.
- [R/explainr](https://github.com/hilaryparker/explainr): translates S3 objects into text using standard templates in a simple and convenient way. 
- [postMUT](https://github.com/stephaniehicks/postMUT): A tool implemented in Perl and R to predict the functionality of missense mutations.


#### Data Packages

- [myAffyData](https://github.com/stephaniehicks/mycAffyData): AffyBatch object from an experiement using P493-6 cells expressing low or high levels of c-Myc. Data from Loven et al. (2012) Cell 151: 476-482.
- [BackgroundExperimentYeast](https://github.com/stephaniehicks/BackgroundExperimentYeast): AffyBatch object from an experiment to measure NSB and optical noise in yeast.
- [colonCancerWGBS](https://github.com/genomicsclass/colonCancerWGBS): Cov files produced from [Bismark](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/) after mapping six paired tumor-normal WGBS samples from Ziller et al. (2013) PMID: 23925113. Only chr22. 

#### Talks

- [Why Statistics Matters in the Analysis of Genomics Data](https://speakerdeck.com/stephaniehicks/why-statistics-matters-in-the-analysis-of-genomics-data): Presented at the LSU Computational Biology seminar and the LSUConnect event in Feb 2015.
