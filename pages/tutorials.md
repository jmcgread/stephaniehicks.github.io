### Odds and Ends
- [General advice on following an academic career path](https://github.com/stephaniehicks/classroomNotes/blob/master/academicJobNotes.md): Contains resources and notes that I've gathered about following an academic career path (from being a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow to faculty). I should preface this by stating this advice is geared towards an applied statistics/genomics field, but I think most of it applies to a broader set of fields.
